Data engineering is the practice of designing and building systems for collecting, storing, and analyzing data at scale.
A data engineer is a technology professional who builds storage solutions for vast amounts of data. The ability to design and build data warehouses is among the top skills clients look for in data engineers. Data warehouses reduce the cost and size of all the tasks a data scientist does.
ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) are the steps which a data engineer follows to build the data pipelines. ETL is a blueprint for how the collected raw data is processed and transformed into data ready for analysis.
